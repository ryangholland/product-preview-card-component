## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project that I consciously tried to approach with a mobile-first design workflow. After finishing the mobile design, I was surprised at how easy it was to get the desktop design working properly with a media query.

I also challenged myself by incorporating a little CSS Grid where I would normally be more comfortable with Flexbox.

### Continued development

I had some trouble getting the image to display properly. It took a lot of trial and error. I got it working, but I still don't fully understand why the properties I used worked the way they did. I'll have to practice some more with background-size/background-position.
